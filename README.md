### Description

NextApp is a dynamic, React-based web application designed to showcase how app management systems work in a simulated environment. Users can browse through a collection of trending and featured apps, view detailed information, and virtually “install” or “uninstall” them with a single click.

Powered by React Router, the app delivers smooth page transitions and a user-friendly experience. It uses localStorage to simulate persistent user actions — giving a realistic feeling of managing apps without any actual downloads.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in ReactJS, component-based architecture, and state management, while also reflecting clean design and functional interactivity.
